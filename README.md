# NFS_v1
Hi, This is Gautam.
This is the same as shown in a tutorial with no mods of my own. 

NOTE: NOT UPDATED.


We first run main.py to capture the screen and input data.

We use the captured data as training data for our convolutional neural network.

We have a new file - training_data.npy

We balance the data to make sure we don't over fit.

We have a new file - training_data_v2.npy

We train our model using training_data_v2.npy

We test our trained model using test_model.py
