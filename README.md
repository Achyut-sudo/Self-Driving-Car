# NFS_v1
This is the same as shown in a tutorial with no mods of my own.

We first run main.py to capture the screen and input data.
We use the captured data as training data for our convolution neural network.
We have a new file - training_data.npy
We balance the data to make sure we don't over fit.
We have a new file - training_data_v2.npy
We train our model using training_data_v2.npy
We test our trained model.
